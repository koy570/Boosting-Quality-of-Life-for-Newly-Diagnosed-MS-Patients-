The investigators hypothesize the proposed 12-week intervention will be feasible based on process, resource, management, and scientific outcomes. The investigators further hypothesize that individuals who receive the 12-week intervention will demonstrate an increase in physical activity behavior, particularly daily step counts, and reduce fatigue."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Multiple Sclerosis (MS)"],"keywords":["Physical activity","Newly diagnosed with MS","Behavior change","Multiple sclerosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"All participants will undergo one intervention condition remotely delivered using electronic newsletters and one-on-one video coaching.

The newsletters will provide the knowledge, skills, resources, and strategies for promoting physical activity in persons newly diagnosed with MS. These newsletters will be released seven times during the program. The first three newsletters will be released weekly, and the last four will be released every other week.\n2. The one-on-one video coaching chats with participants will be conducted via Zoom, which consist of discussion and elaboration of newsletters content, supportive accountability, feedback and encouragement on behavior change. The chats further provide social persuasion for promoting behavior change. The chats are semi-scripted and individualized interventions (\\~15 - 30 minutes/chat). The chats will occur seven times during the week when a newsletter is delivered.\n3. The intervention includes a pedometer (NL-800 pedometer), a logbook, and a calendar for tracking daily step counts, planning of physical activity, setting goals, and monitoring progress over the program.","armGroupLabels":["Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behavior (COM-B) based physical activity behavioral intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility metric: Process","description":"Process assesses participant recruitment, retention, and adherence i.
